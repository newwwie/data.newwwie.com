We are a monthly meetup that welcomes all ages, skill levels and backgrounds of the data community in Newcastle and the Hunter Region.

All we ask, is for you to bring your curiosity and a top notch attitude!

We also strongly encourage ties between academia and industry as well as student engagement.

Meetups are a monthly careers expo after all.

Join us!

We encourage members of the community to share you work via this page by adding to the [repository](https://github.com/JackMcKew/hunterdataanalytics)!
